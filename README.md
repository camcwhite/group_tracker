# Group session Tracker

 This is a simple app built using Tkinter (using PySimpleGUI as a wrapper) that tracks participation in group sessions and generates reports from that data. 

Using is very simple:
  - To create a new session record:
    - Click 'Add Group Session' from the main menu and enter information for that session. 
    - Participants can either be entered one at a time using the text box next to 'Participants' (press Enter to add a name) or pasted/edited in the text box below 'Participants'.
  - To edit a session record:
    - Click 'Edit Group Sessions' from the main menu. Select which record to edit using the 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons at the top of the page. 
    - When you are done editing a session, click 'Save' to save your changes.
    - To delete a record click 'Delete' at the bottom of the page (warning: there is no warning after clicking, the record is immediately deleted).
  - To generate a report from saved data:
    - Click 'Create Report' from the main menu.
    - Enter start date in YYYY-MM-DD format (example: 2021-09-12 for September 12, 2021)
    - Enter end date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - Click 'PDF' to save report to a PDF (.pdf) file (after choosing a save location and file name)
    - Click 'Text' to save report to a text (.txt) file (after choosing a save location and file name)
